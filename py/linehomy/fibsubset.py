'''Produce Fibonacci subsets

Each Fibonacci number counts how many sequences of 1's and 2's there
are with a given sum.  We define the *subordinate* relation, that
associates to each such sequence a subset of other such sequences.
This is used to define the (candidate) formula for linear homology
Betti numbers.
